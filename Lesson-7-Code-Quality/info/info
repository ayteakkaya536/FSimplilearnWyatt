A quote by Jason Hathorne:
"I prefer Sonarqube as it is language agnostic.  You just need to add the sonar-scanner
to collect the test output and it will push it to the Sonarqube scanner.  Sonarqube will
make the analysis and will trigger the stop gate via the sonar-scanner.  I have used it for
.Net, .NetCore, JavaScript and Python projects.  JavaScript has its own sonar-scanner.js you
add as a dev dependency.  .Net and Python have scanners you can add to the project, or if you
are building in docker select a docker image from docker hub with the sonar-scanner included
so you only need a sonar-scanner.properties file."
